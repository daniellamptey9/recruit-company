# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Revert Vendor from Git Later

## Current Status
The `vendor` folder is **temporarily included in Git** to fix the deployment issue.

## When to Revert

**After your website is fully functional**, you should:

1. **Add vendor back to .gitignore:**
   ```
   /vendor
   ```

2. **Remove vendor from Git:**
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached vendor
   git commit -m "Remove vendor folder from Git - use composer install instead"
   git push
   ```

## Why Revert?

- Vendor folder is **large** (~64 MB) and makes Git repository bloated
- Standard Laravel practice is to **ignore vendor** and run `composer install` on server
- Git repository will be cleaner and faster without vendor
- When deploying, you'll run: `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` on server

## Current Solution

For now, this allows the website to work immediately after deploying from Git without needing Composer on the server.

**Note:** This is a temporary fix. Revert once everything is working properly!
